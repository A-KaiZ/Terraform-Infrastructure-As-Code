## **Getting Started**

This project demonstrates how to provision a network infrastructure on OpenStack using Terraform. The infrastructure sets up three virtual machines with pre-configured networking, ready to be used for a Kubernetes cluster or similar environments. 

---

## **Prerequisites**

To use this project, ensure you have the following:

- OpenStack CLI installed.
- Access to an OpenStack environment.
- Terraform installed locally.
- A valid `.env` file containing your OpenStack credentials.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

---

### Step 2: Update Your OpenStack Credentials

1. Locate the `.env` file in the root directory of this project. This file contains placeholders for your OpenStack credentials.

2. Open the file using your preferred text editor:
    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

3. Update the file with your OpenStack credentials:
   ```bash
   OS_USERNAME=your_openstack_username
   OS_PROJECT_NAME=your_project_name
   OS_PASSWORD=your_password
   OS_AUTH_URL=http://your_openstack_auth_url/v3
   ```

4. (Optional) If your environment uses custom domain names, you can update these fields:
   ```bash
   OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=your_user_domain_name
   OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=your_project_domain_name
   ```

5. Save the file and ensure it is not committed to version control. The `.env` file is already included in the `.gitignore` for your convenience.

> **Note:** If the credentials are incorrect, Terraform will fail to authenticate with OpenStack. Make sure you validate your credentials with the OpenStack CLI (`openstack server list`) before proceeding.

4. Save the file.

### Step 3: Configure SSH Keys

1. Open the `variables.tf` file and provide your public SSH key(s):
   ```hcl
   variable "personal_public_key" {
     default = "your_personal_public_key_here"
   }

   variable "admin_public_key" {
     default = "your_admin_public_key_here"
   }
   ```

2. If you donâ€™t have a public key, you can generate one using:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

---

### Step 4: Initialize Terraform

Run the following commands to initialize Terraform and validate the setup:
```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
```

---

### Step 5: Deploy the Infrastructure

1. Deploy the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
2. Review the changes and type `yes` to confirm.

---

### Step 6: Verifying the Setup

Once deployed, Terraform will output the created resources. Ensure everything is set up by:

1. Logging into the OpenStack dashboard.
2. Checking the three virtual machines and their network settings.
3. Using `ssh` to access the instances (use the private key corresponding to the public key you specified).

---

### Notes for Customization

- **Credentials:** Credentials are securely managed using a `.env` file and are not hardcoded for security reasons. Always keep the `.env` file private and excluded from version control.
- **SSH Keys:** Ensure your public SSH keys are correctly added to `variables.tf` to access the instances.
- **OpenStack Authentication:** If there are any issues, confirm your OpenStack credentials and API access using the OpenStack CLI (`openstack server list`).
